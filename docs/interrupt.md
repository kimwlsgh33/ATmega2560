> Is it usuall to manage interrupt enabling like this code?

Looking at the uart_getchar() implementation, the interrupt management approach could be improved. The current code disables and re-enables the receive interrupt (RXCIE0) during the function, which is a common pattern but has some issues:

1. If an interrupt occurs between disabling and re-enabling, it could be missed
2. The code re-enables the interrupt even when returning with no data
3. The interrupt management adds overhead for each character read

A better approach would be to:

1. Use atomic operations or proper critical section management
2. Only disable interrupts when absolutely necessary
3. Keep the critical section as short as possible

Here's how I would improve it:

uart.c
Replace lines: 29-44

```c
int uart_getchar(char *c)
{
  uint8_t sreg = SREG;  // Save interrupt state
  cli();                // Disable interrupts globally

  if (rx_len > 0) {
    *c = rx_buff[rx_head];
    rx_head = (rx_head + 1) % UART_BUFF_SIZE;
    --rx_len;

    SREG = sreg;        // Restore interrupt state
    return 1;
  }

  SREG = sreg;          // Restore interrupt state
  return 0;
}

int uart1_getchar(char *c)
{
  cbi(UCSR1B, RXCIE1);

  if (rx_len > 0) {
    *c = rx_buff[rx_head];
    rx_head = (rx_head + 1) % UART_BUFF_SIZE;
    --rx_len;

    sbi(UCSR1B, RXCIE1);
    return 1;
  }

  sbi(UCSR1B, RXCIE1);
  return 0;
}
```

This improved version:

1. Uses global interrupt disable/enable instead of just UART interrupts
2. Properly saves and restores the interrupt state
3. Has a shorter critical section
4. Is more reliable since it uses atomic operations

The pattern of saving SREG, disabling interrupts, doing critical work, and restoring SREG is a standard approach in AVR programming for protecting shared resources between ISRs and main code.

Would you like me to explain more about why this approach is better or would you like to see other improvements to the UART code?
